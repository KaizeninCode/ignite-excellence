            In the journey to expand our reach and coverage each year, we open opportunities and seek new partnerships with like-minded partners who share our passion for childcare and have strong educational acumen. <br /> <br />Once a partner is assessed and certified as an IGNITE&reg; excellence center, you&apos;ll benefit from our extensive experience as part of the largest provider of out-of-school hours care solutions and our international play-based association memberships. <br /> <br />Join our community-focused team and tap into our collective knowledge, integrity and expertise to make a positive impact on our children&apos;s lives.
